Set the AES key, user ID and other settings in a YubiKey\&. For the complete explanation of the meaning of all parameters, see the reference manual: YubiKey manual (https://www\&.yubico\&.com/wp\-content/uploads/2015/03/YubiKeyManual_v3\&.4\&.pdf)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB−1\fR

\fB\-oappend\-cr\fR

\fB\-oappend\-cr\fR,
\fB\-ostatic\-ticket\fR,
\fB\-ostrong\-pw1\fR,
\fB\-ostrong\-pw2\fR

\fB\-oman\-update\fR

.RE

.RS 4

\fB−a\fR
is not used a random key will be generated\&.
.RE

\fB−c\fR\fIxxx\fR
.RS 4

\fB\-oaccess\fR\fI=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB−o\fR\fIoption\fR
.RS 4
change configuration option\&. Possible option arguments are:
.PP
\fBfixed\fR=\fIfffffffffff\fR
.RS 4
The modhex
\fIpublic identity\fR
of the YubiKey, 0\-32 characters long (encoding up to 16 bytes)\&. It\(cqs possible to give the identity in hex as well, just prepend the value with \(cqh:\(cq\&. The fixed part is emitted before the OTP when the button on the YubiKey is pressed\&. It can be used as an identifier for the user, for example\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuid\fR=\fIuuuuuu\fR
.RS 4
The uid part of the generated OTP, also called
\fIprivate identity\fR, in hex\&. Must be 12 characters long\&. The uid is 6 bytes of static data that is included (encrypted) in every OTP, and is used to validate that an OTP was in fact encrypted with the AES key shared between the YubiKey and the validation service\&. It cannot be used to identify the YubiKey as it is only readable to those that know the AES key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBaccess\fR=\fIfffffffffff\fR
.RS 4
New hex access code to set\&. Must be 12 characters long\&. If an access code is set, it will be required for subsequent reprogramming of the YubiKey\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoath\-imf\fR=\fIxxx\fR

\fBshort\-ticket\fR

Limit the length of the static string to max 16 digits\&. This flag only makes sense with the
\fB\-ostatic\-ticket\fR
option\&. When
\fB\-oshort\-ticket\fR

\fB\-ostatic\-ticket\fR
it will program the YubiKey in "scan\-code mode", in this mode the key sends the contents of fixed, uid and key as raw keyboard scancodes\&. For example, by using the fixed string
\fIh:8b080f0f122c9a12150f079e\fR
in this mode it will send
\fIHello World!\fR
on a qwerty keyboard\&. This mode sends raw scan codes, so output will differ between keyboard layouts\&.
.RE

.PP
\fBoath\-id\fR[=m:OOTTUUUUUUUU]
.RS 4
Configure OATH token id with a provided value, or if used without a value use the standard YubiKey token identifier\&.
.RE
.sp
The standard OATH token id for a Yubico YubiKey is (modhex) OO=ub, TT=he, (decimal) UUUUUUUU=serial number\&.
.sp
The reason for the decimal serial number is to make it easy for humans to correlate the serial number on the back of the YubiKey to an entry in a list of associated tokens for example\&. Other encodings can be accomplished using the appropriate oath\-fixed\-modhex options\&.
.sp
Note that the YubiKey must be programmed to allow reading its serial number, otherwise automatic token id creation is not possible\&.
.sp

.SS "Challenge\-response Mode"
.sp
In \fBCHAL\-RESP\fR mode, the token will NOT generate any keypresses when the button is pressed (although it is perfectly possible to have one slot with a keypress\-generating configuration, and the other in challenge\-response mode)\&. Instead, a program capable of sending USB HID feature reports to the token must be used to send it a challenge, and read the response\&.
.SS "Modhex"
.sp
Modhex is a way of writing hex digits where the \(lqdigits\(rq are chosen for being in the same place on most keyboard layouts\&. To convert from hex to modhex, you can use:

.\}
.nf
tr "[0123456789abcdef]" "[cbdefghijklnrtuv]"

.if n \{\
